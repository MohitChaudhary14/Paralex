            <h2>ADVENTURE TIME</h2>
            <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience. It can be an undertaking that is
                potentially risky or dangerous, Collecting, exploration and discovery are often considered to be
                adventures. They can be physical, such as climbing a mountain or exploring a jungle, or mental and
                emotional, such as overcoming personal challenges or achieving a difficult goal. Adventure can also be
                found in everyday life, such as trying new things or stepping out of one's comfort zone. It is often
                seen as a way to push boundaries, test limits and gain new perspectives
                <br><br>
                Additionally, adventure can be a shared experience, such as traveling with friends or family, or it can
                be a solo journey. Many people seek out adventure as a way to challenge themselves and test their
                limits, both physically and mentally.

                <h2 class="desc">Biking</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Mountain biking is a sport that involves riding bicycles off-road on rough terrain such as mountains,
                hills, and rough trails. It is a physically demanding activity that requires a combination of endurance,
                strength, and skill. Mountain bikers need to have a good understanding of the terrain, as well as the
                ability to navigate obstacles such as rocks, roots, and drops. They also need to be able to handle their
                bike at high speeds and maintain control on steep descent.
                <br><br>
                The sport has different disciplines, such as cross country, downhill, freeride and enduro, each one with
                its own characteristics and challenges. Cross country riding is characterized by long distances and
                challenging climbs, while downhill riding is focused on speed and technical descents. Freeride is a more
                acrobatic and spectacular discipline, where riders perform jumps and tricks. Enduro is a combination of
                cross country and downhill, where riders need to maintain a good pace over long distances and different
                terrains.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is a recreational and competitive adventure sport where a person flies in a lightweight,
                free-flying, foot-launched aircraft called a paraglider. The pilot sits in a harness suspended below a
                fabric wing, which is constructed of ripstop nylon material. The wing is inflated by the wind and allows
                the pilot to fly in the air by controlling the direction and speed of the flight using a combination of
                brakes and a control handle called a "tow".
                <br><br>
                Paragliding can be done by foot launch, from a hill or mountain, or by winch launch, which uses a
                mechanized device to pull the paraglider into the air. The flight can last from a few minutes to several
                hours, depending on the weather conditions and the skill of the pilot.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                There are different types of surfing such as longboarding, shortboarding, and stand-up paddle surfing.
                Longboarding is characterized by larger and more stable boards, and a more relaxed style of riding,
                while shortboarding is characterized by smaller and more maneuverable boards and a more aggressive style
                of riding. Stand-up paddle surfing, also known as stand-up paddleboarding (SUP), is a variant of surfing
                where the surfer stands on a board and uses a paddle to propel themselves through the water.
                <br><br>
                Surfing is a popular sport around the world and is enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. It is
                also considered a cultural activity, with a strong connection to the ocean and beach lifestyle.
